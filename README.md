The project mainly required using fetch and axios to get countries and Covid information from their respective api.
In order to avoid multiple calls to the api, I did one call in the beginning and then kept the information in a seperate synchronous array for future convinience.
Unfortunatly there are some responsive issues because I had to use position: relative, other than the app runs well.

Since it is my first time working with asynchronous coding within such a large project I had some issues approaching several objects/arrays that had the information I needed to see.

Working with chart.js went surprisingly relativly smooth, chart js documantation is quite helpful and self explainatory.
